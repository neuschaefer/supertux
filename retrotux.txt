Fork SuperTux 0.1.3 as retrotux

I am forking the "old" SuperTux, because I grew up with it and I want it to
live on. SuperTux Milestone 2 is a fine game, and a worthy successor, but it's
a different game, too.

With retrotux, I will follow these goals:
* Keep the gameplay, sounds, graphics the same
* Be light on system resources. I want to play this game on systems with 32MiB
  of RAM and less!
* Fix bugs both in the "infrastructure" parts of the codebase and in the UI.
  For example, there's currently no way to play the bonus levels.
* Improve the readability of the code base, by cleaning it up a little.
